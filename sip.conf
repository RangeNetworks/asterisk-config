bindport=5060			; asterisk 1.6
				; UDP Port to bind to (SIP standard port for unencrypted UDP 
				; and TCP sessions is 5060)
				; bindport is the local UDP port that Asterisk will listen on
bindaddr=0.0.0.0		; asterisk 1.6
				; IP address to bind UDP listen socket to (0.0.0.0 binds to all)
				; You can specify port here too, like 123.123.123.123:5080
udpbindaddr=0.0.0.0		; asterisk 1.8
				; IP address to bind UDP listen socket to (0.0.0.0 binds to all)
				; Optionally add a port number, 192.168.1.1:5062 (default is port 5060)

tos_sip=cs3			; Sets TOS for SIP packets.
tos_audio=ef			; Sets TOS for RTP audio packets.
tos_video=af41			; Sets TOS for RTP video packets.
tos_text=af41			; Sets TOS for RTP text packets.

cos_sip=3			; Sets 802.1p priority for SIP packets.
cos_audio=5			; Sets 802.1p priority for RTP audio packets.
cos_video=4			; Sets 802.1p priority for RTP video packets.
cos_text=3			; Sets 802.1p priority for RTP text packets.

maxexpiry=3600			; Maximum allowed time of incoming registrations
				; and subscriptions (seconds)
minexpiry=60			; Minimum length of registrations/subscriptions (default 60)
defaultexpiry=3600		; Default length of incoming/outgoing registration
dynamic_exclude_static=yes	; Disallow all dynamic hosts from registering
				; as any IP address used for staticly defined
				; hosts.  This helps avoid the configuration
				; error of allowing your users to register at
				; the same address as a SIP provider.
use_q850_reason=yes		; Set to yes add Reason header and use Reason header if it is available.

;t1min=100			; Minimum roundtrip time for messages to monitored hosts
				; Defaults to 100 ms
;timert1=500			; Default T1 timer
				; Defaults to 500 ms or the measured round-trip
				; time to a peer (qualify=yes).
;timerb=32000			; Call setup timer. If a provisional response is not received
				; in this amount of time, the call will autocongest
				; Defaults to 64*timert1
rtptimeout=60			; Terminate call if 60 seconds of no RTP or RTCP activity
				; on the audio channel
				; when we're not on hold. This is to be able to hangup
				; a call in the case of a phone disappearing from the net,
				; like a powerloss or grandma tripping over a cable.
rtpholdtimeout=300		; Terminate call if 300 seconds of no RTP or RTCP activity
				; on the audio channel
				; when we're on hold (must be > rtptimeout)

;allowguest=no			; Allow or reject guest calls (default is yes)
autocreatepeer=yes		; The Autocreatepeer option allows, 
				; if set to Yes, any SIP ua to register with your Asterisk PBX as a peer. 
				; This peer's settings will be based on global options. 
				; The peer's name will be based on the user part of the Contact: header field's URL. 

context=phones			; Default context for incoming calls
allowoverlap=no			; Disable overlap dialing support. (Default is yes)

disallow=all			; need to disallow=all before we can use allow=
allow=gsm			; GSM
allow=ulaw			; ISDN US
allow=alaw			; ISDN EU

relaxdtmf=yes			; Relax dtmf handling (only to be used for connecting to aserisk 1.2 and INDBAND)
dtmfmode=rfc2833		; Set default dtmfmode for sending DTMF. Default: rfc2833
				; Other options:
				; info : SIP INFO messages (application/dtmf-relay)
				; shortinfo : SIP INFO messages (application/dtmf)
				; inband : Inband audio (requires 64 kbit codec -alaw, ulaw)
				; auto : Use rfc2833 if offered, inband otherwise

canreinvite=no			; no reinvites from Asterisk

directmedia=no			; Asterisk by default tries to redirect the
				; RTP media stream to go directly from
				; the caller to the callee.  Some devices do not
				; support this (especially if one of them is behind a NAT).
				; The default setting is YES. If you have all clients
				; behind a NAT, or for some other reason want Asterisk to
				; stay in the audio path, you may want to turn this off.

				; This setting also affect direct RTP
				; at call setup (a new feature in 1.4 - setting up the
				; call directly between the endpoints instead of sending
				; a re-INVITE).

;call-limit=1			; permit only 1 outgoing call and 1 incoming call at a time
				; from the phone to asterisk (deprecated)
				; 1 for the explicit peer, 1 for the explicit user,
				; remember that a friend equals 1 peer and 1 user in
				; memory
				; There is no combined call counter for a "friend"
				; so there's currently no way in sip.conf to limit
				; to one inbound or outbound call per phone. Use
				; the group counters in the dial plan for that.
;busylevel=1;			; Signal busy at 1 or more calls

callcounter=yes			; Enable call counters on devices. This can be set per
				; device too.
